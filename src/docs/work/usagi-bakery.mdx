## Overview

I created this website for my girlfriend who had recently launched her vegan bakery business, Usagi.Bakery. I decided to build her site using Gatsby, for the ssg performance & seo benefits, as well as access to their vast plugin library.

Product management and payments are handled securely using the Stripe API (client-side) and the blog is handled using Sanity headless CMS (I built the schema and hosted it seperately)

### Problems Solved

- Needed fast performant site
- Available offline for product viewing
- Secure payment handling
- Easy CMS for client
